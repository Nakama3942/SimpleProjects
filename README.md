# SimpleProjects
## Overview
Here I post simple projects that I have ever written. These projections are not very important, but these codes can be used as part of other, larger projects. They may not be perfect, but this is not necessary, since their purpose is to display certain algorithms. I am just learning, and these works will be useful to those who are also studying.

## Building
Each code is just a solution to a problem. You need:
1. Create a new project independently in any IDE and copy all the code into it;
2. Or, in the console, write commands for assembling like:

>g++ -Wall -c CommPay.cpp

>g++ -no-pie -o CommPay CommPay.o
