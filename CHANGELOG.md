## v0.2.0 (25 Jan 2021)

#### Enhancements:
- After a month's rest, I decided to sit down to review the old codes. I rewrote almost all of the codes almost completely, making them already procedural programs, and the codes look more beautiful. For history, I added all the old codes to the "furui code" archive. Recently I switched to Linux (to be more precise - KDE Neon) and new programs are designed to be compiled only for Linux, I have not tested them on Windows. But that with 95% confidence I can conclude that the Russian language will work only on Linux, and on Windows there will be only clicks, since I removed the terminal switching from the standard encoding to Cyrillic 1251 (which Windows requires).
